What do *we*, the humans, make the machines do?

Our life today is tightly controlled by machines, by smartphones being our constant companions, to the internet first ripping people apart, and then bringing them back together, but in ways they could never have imagined.

And now AI. I'm certainly not someone who things anything is hopeless. The OpenAI people are doing great work when it comes to AI safety. The world hasn't exploded yet.

But I also don't think the main "thing we should be afraid of" is humanity being killed. I think there is a much worse hell: Being average.

Breaking your back for promotions you'll never get, for bosses you hate, or for an economy that makes you feel like *you* are the problem. But that's what you deserve when you stay average.

That doesn't mean that I want everyone to be "not average". I certain share of average people is great, because they keep the world going, but I want more. Love is one of the New Normals.
